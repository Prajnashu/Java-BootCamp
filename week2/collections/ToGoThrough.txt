functional interface;
    Interface have only one abstract method. 4 main functional interface: 
    1.consumer: One argument, no return type.
    2.Predicate: one argument, some processing, return boolean value.
    3.Function: one argument, some processing, return value.
    4.supplier: no argument, return value.
implement comparator using lambda;
comparable and comparator interface;
    comparable interface has the compareTo method that needs to be implemented by the implementing class. For comparator, it does not need to implement the comparator interface, more than one compare methods can be used for comparator interface which is pretty cool.
Wrapper classes, use your custom classes instead of wrapper classes in java.

Go through hashing techniques.

comparable changes the class that implements it while comparator doesn't change the class.
Generics and wildcard: upperbound, lowerbound, unbounded.
serialsation and deserialisation: mostly used with databases(JPA, hibernate); transient keyword,serialversionUID
